# Coffee-Machine-Program
This Coffee Machine Program is a simulation of a real coffee machine. Users can order different types of coffee, insert coins to pay, and get a report of available resources. The machine also tracks profit and ensures resources are sufficient before making a coffee.

# Features
- Choose from three types of coffee: **Espresso**, **Latte**, or **Cappuccino**.
- Coin-based payment system accepting quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
- Automated resource checking to ensure sufficient ingredients for each order.
- Displays change if overpaid.
- Report feature to show current resources and earnings.
- Turn off the machine using the "off" command.

# How it Works
* **Order Coffee:** The user is prompted to select a coffee type from espresso, latte, or cappuccino.
* **Resource Check:** The program checks if there are enough resources (water, milk, coffee) to make the selected coffee.
* **Insert Coins:** The user inserts coins to pay for the coffee. If the amount inserted is insufficient, the transaction is canceled.
* **Make Coffee:** If the payment is successful, the coffee is made, and resources are deducted.
* **Report:** The user can check the machineâ€™s resource levels and profit by typing "report".
* **Turn Off:** The machine can be powered off by typing "off".
